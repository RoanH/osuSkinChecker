# osu! Skin Checker
Simple program to check if all elements for an osu! skin are present.

# Forum post
So a little while ago I was asked to write a program to show what files were missing in a skin.<br>
And now I'm finally done :D

The program looks like this:<br>

It is a simple program that shows you which elements of your skin are skinned and which elements are not. It also shows if there's an SD/HD image in the skin for each element or not. For files that can be animated it also shows whether or not they are animated. Lastly it also reports a missing skin.ini file and will read and use custom paths from the skin.ini if they exist.

Well I hope some of you find this program useful :)<br>
And if you find any bugs feel free to report them (spelling mistakes included :3).
